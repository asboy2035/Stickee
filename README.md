Stickee is a sticky notes app for Mac that's inspired from the macOS system stickies app as well as the Raycast Notes feature.

### Running the app
As I don't have a paid developer account, this app is not notarized.
If you have issues running the app, try referring to this article -> https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-launch-any-macos-app-even-those-not-notarized-by-apple

> Stickee is in development.
